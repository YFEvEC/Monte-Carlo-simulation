## **Simulation Study of Strategic Games**

### **Overview**

This repository contains a detailed study on the simulation of various strategic games, exploring the interplay between randomness and strategy. The goal is not merely to identify the "best" strategy, but to compare multiple strategies and determine their effectiveness.

### **Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites**
    - Ensure you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) or the relevant language installed for the simulation.
    - Clone this repository to your local machine.
    
    ```
    git clone [repository-link]
    ```

2. **Installation**
    - Install necessary packages or libraries stated in the simulation code files.

### **Repository Structure**

- `src/`: Directory containing all source code for the simulations.
- `data/`: Directory with datasets and simulation outcomes.
- `plots/`: Visual representations of simulations, convergence plots, and histograms.
- `docs/`: Supplementary documentation, if any.

### **Simulation Ideas Explored**

1. Extension of existing game simulations.
2. Exploration of strategic card/dice games.
3. Board games that meld randomness with strategy.
4. Escape strategies from various terrains.
5. Innovations on Buffon's needle experiment.
6. Deep dives into queuing theory.

*Note: The above list is not exhaustive.*

### **Key Features**

- **Central Limit Theorem Application:** Each simulation incorporates the CLT to ensure robust statistical analysis.
- **Convergence Plots:** These plots validate the adequacy of simulation runs.
- **Histograms:** Provide a visual approximation of the normal distribution nature of outcomes.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Integral to the analysis, enabling statistically significant claims.
